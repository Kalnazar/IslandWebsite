# IslandWebsite
This is just an inspiring site with a beautiful design. I created this site for the Final Project in the discipline of Web-technologies, it was in the first year, Astana IT University.
Nice design and nice code. If you combine 
them, you get something wonderful. The purpose of the site was to attract customers thanks to the 
design and convenience of the site, I think that everyone who visits this site will not remain 
indifferent, and leave their contact information, and finally get away from all the fuss )
